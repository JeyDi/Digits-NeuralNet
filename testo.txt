The assignment consists on the prediction of letters from grayscale images of letters A - J.



The data can be loaded as follows:

import pickle 

x_train = pickle.load(open("x_train.obj","rb"))

x_test = pickle.load(open("x_test.obj","rb"))

y_train = pickle.load(open("y_train.obj","rb"))



The provided data comprises the training set that can be used for the training (and eventually for the validation) and the unlabelled test set.



In order to be evaluated, each student should submit (strictly before the deadline):

the source code;
a brief report (1 or 2 pages) in pdf or doc format with some motivations about the choices about: data processing, number and dimension of the layers, optimization algorithms and regularization;
(optional) investigate the use of the hidden representation obtained with auto-encoder architectures for predicting the labels (a notebook with an example has been uploaded)
(optional) a txt file named Nome_Cognome_Matricola_score2.txt, where each line corresponds to the prediction (a letter comprises between A and J) of the instances of the test set.
Collaboration is allowed, but the final product must be individual.
